    # I'm drawing white lines under black lines to create a
    # front-obscures-back effect: -|-
    #
    # I also want corners with a fat point to look "clean" with points not
    # obscured by any of the meeting lines - even back points by lines
    # coming from front.  However, unrelated lines in front should obscure
    # points.  Sounds tricky, but that's not the hard part.
    #
    # Mistake 1: I'd thought that since my projection is always onto a fixed-Z
    # plane, I can order objects solely by their absolute Z coordinate (after
    # 4D->3D transform, but disregarding camera location).  I can't, because when
    # camera looks from the left, the left side should obscure the right part
    # (with exactly same Z coordinates), and vice versa.
    #
    # Mistake 2: Expecting I just need a better formula for an object's z-order, e.g.
    # distance from camera to infinite continuation of a line (doesn't work).
    #
    # Mistake 3: Expecting I can at least write a pairwise comparison function.
    # In *general position*, lines obsrcuring might not be transitive!
    # You can lay sticks like this:
    #      |  |
    #     ----|-
    #      |  |

    # Unfortunately I don't have time to debug this further, so here is my
    # heuristic from 2009:
    #
    # 1. Sort lines by (farthest_point, closest_point).  This way front lines
    #    obscure back-front connecting lines which obscure back lines.  The order
    #    of the 2 is not very important for lines [*]_, but having farthest first
    #    allows a fat point at line's back end to still not be obscured by white line
    #    whose depth starts with farthest_point + epsilon.  Kludge...
    #
    #    .. [*] It is important outer vs inner line crossings, but either way gets
    #       some of them wrong.
    #
    # with a mild improvements:
    #
    # 2. Sort points as (depth, depth) for consistency, and the image as
    #    (farthest_corner, closest_corner).  [In 2009 I always drew points and
    #    image after lines.]
    #
    # 3. Measure point depth by (z, -pythagorean distance) to camera.  Distance
    #    to camera gets the right-vs-left depending on camera position part
    #    mostly right, and *mostly* doesn't cause other bugs.  (z, -distance) causes
    #    slightly less bugs.
